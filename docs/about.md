- Heritage Hill
    
    So, I need your help in really telling the story, because I've just talked, and you can document what you can kind of document around campus. And so Heritage has started with the vision for making the ancestors proud. And so, part of that was growing up around, and my mother's an educator. And so, I was just, had just been laid off from my job in financial services. And I wanted to start a company. I always wanted to build an organization, you know. I wanted to build a company. I learned about entrepreneurship, and my goal was to build a company. But then I learned about capitalism, like how capitalism really worked. And so, part of the thinking was, I wanted to build a company that would make the ancestors proud, make my ancestors proud. And so, in that, I thought the focus would be on a business that was for Black people of the diaspora, by people of the diaspora. So, of course, that took me to a couple lanes. It took me, you know, with, you know, actually, I started as just a t-shirt company. I was making t-shirts for my high school, people within my high school, you know, reunions, custom t-shirts. And I realized that like a lot of the public schools didn't have, a lot of the public schools didn't have spirit shops. And so, I thought it would be a really cool idea to have spirit shops that were in the public schools that could be student-led, student-ran, student-organized. We would be able to teach entrepreneurial lessons through practical hands-on experience through this spirit shop. And the spirit shop could be online. So, it would be an online store, and you can learn as much as you needed to learn with an online store about business. You could teach business concepts with this online store, and they can actually develop and sell a product. And like, if this could get access to a supply chain, if it could get access to a vendor, then you could just sell your own, you could make your own jerseys, right? Like, the schools could have more control. So, the public school, there's not a lot of, there isn't any infrastructure in the public school system around apparel, because nobody's really, you don't know if people will buy their high school apparel, because there isn't really any major player that's doing it. And so, the organization that creates, right, an online platform that sales and distributes, and that would be the goal. And so, I thought that that would be an interesting model. And so, what happened was, because I was doing it for high schools, then people from colleges started to ask me to do it. And so, I started doing it for college friends. And so, some of my friends went to HBCUs. And so, I did it for HBCUs. And it was like, wow, you know, what would it look like if we could take this kind of thinking with the high school spirit shops, we could take this into HBCUs, like the spirit shops, the co-ops, not the co-ops, I'm sorry, we didn't make it the co-ops yet. The spirit shops would act as a hands-on interactive classroom that they would also be able to sell the apparel, right? And so, we got licensed, right? I wanted to see if that was a viable model, what would that look like? And so, I thought like, man, this is a really great opportunity. This is a good business idea. And what got built into that was, how can we build that as a business? I'm like, man, I put together an entire business plan around, how could we build, how could we attach ourselves to the school spirit shops as a learning, like this would be a learning. They could develop their own products, like Polo put out its own line with Spelman and Morehouse. And it's like, man, what happens if the school has more ownership on that process? How do we get manufacturing? How do we build the manufacturing to be able to do that? And so, that was the test to see what is the business viability of it, right? How would we do it? How would we do it? How could we create it? And so, we started, Heritage Hill started as an attempt to build the supply chain. How could we build the network of suppliers, printers? Like, how could we start on that, right? That was the thought. And so, we got licensed. We got licensed. We got a relationship with Belk. We wanted to learn how to do it. Because what if we could come become the back-end supply chain for historically black colleges and universities? Not only that, just black college apparel, fraternities and sororities, HBCUs. And how do we organize that? And so, we landed on that as a business model. And so, we're like, man, that's a really good business model. That could be, there's viable customers. Then if we could take ownership of the supply chain, because really the thought is that when we create black business ecosystems, we need to acquire supply chains. What is the supply chain that we're in, textile? We could create a textile. We could get a part of a supply chain in textile. We have makers. We have creators. We just need the manufacturing. All right. How does Heritage Hill create the manufacturing for that, right? Or how do we proceduralize and operationalize in a way that makes it equitable for all the parties? And so, that's where it being a co-op made sense. And so, as we started to go along on this journey and learn, like, how do we do this in a way? We learned, like, man, the way to do this is through a co-op, is cooperatives at each stage gate of the process, right? But what did we learn? One of our biggest learnings in that, in funding, how did the funding work? Okay. That's the next phase, how it was funded. That's like the business. Turn into a co-op, multi-stakeholder co-op across multi-supply chains, right? We have a buying customers between the schools. So, we mapped all of that. So, that's the business. So, how did it get funded?

    So I didn't even know what ChatGPT was, or a large language model was, until OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public. And I remember asking myself that, and I was already doing like voice notes, so I was doing voice notes, and I remember asking myself like, man, I wish there was a service or a product that would allow me to take my thoughts, because they're always racing, they're always running so fast, I wish there was something that could allow me to spill my thoughts out, and it would organize it for me, it would organize it into something more coherent, because, man, my mind is always moving. And so when ChatGPT came out, I'm like, whoa, this is it, this is what I've been waiting all my life for, but really, this was a great invention. And so I started to use it like most people, just curious, and then I didn't realize, started to research on what it was doing, how it was creating information, and how I had a background in marketing, and I was having discussions around how to put together a marketing strategy, and it was actually pretty good, you know? Like I was talking about Facebook ads, I'm like, wow, it's pretty proficient in its information that it's delivering. And so, of course, I'm obsessed, I've been obsessed for the last two years in using it, and the biggest, biggest things for me is that it's taught me more in the last two years than I've learned in the last 10 years. I've learned at an exceptional pace in being able to turn my ideas into action. There's so many countless use cases that I have, it's made me incredibly more confident in my abilities. Like right now, I've taught myself how to code, right? Like the last time I asked ChatGPT, like I can go and put together a GitHub, download repositories, review the code, add features, change features. I've developed front end and back end, full stack applications using Python, using generative AI, using React, using all these things, like I'm using different suites of AI tools, right? Like I know all the different tools, I've used them, I've tried them, I've completely immersed myself in this, I've evangelized, I've told friends, I've met with hundreds of people on how they can use it. I've co-scholared in a class for Illinois State University, I did a tech youth summit, where I was the workshop and presenter and speaker, I've written about AI, I've talked about AI and linguistic capital, how it's going to be center, because it's a large language model, I've talked about how it's gonna impact in workforce development, how AI technology, AI innovation doesn't follow traditional models of technological explosion, it limits the upstream and downstream capabilities, I've talked about how knowledge is gonna impact knowledge work, I've talked about how we've been, productivity has outpaced worker wages, and now we're looking at where wages are made to be more impacted, and people's ability to be able to have jobs could be impacted, I think AI, generative AI, GPT technology is going to change the way that we live, the way that we work and the way that we learn, and so my big focus is on, one, helping people, it's helped me become more confident, it's helped me be more creative, learn more, and because I've immersed myself in the tool, I know how to use the tools, and the tool is helping me learn more things, and so I think that it's unbelievable, and more people, we're looking at access, accessibility, ethics, and so Rudy is Responsible Use of Digital Intelligence, R-U-D-I, Responsible Use of Digital Intelligence, and so right now we're just researching, I've been on research, asking people, trying to just delve more into how generative AI, GPT technology is going to impact society and culture, particularly education.
